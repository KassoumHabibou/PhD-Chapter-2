Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Bangladesh 2000 DHS GPS data.  
The data named BDGE41FL had substantial problems with the locations and identification of the the clusters.   
These issues have been resolved in the newly issued data file BDGE42FL. 
Please use these data for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  
We apologize for any confusion this may cause you.
